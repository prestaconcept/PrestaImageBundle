## Overview

PrestaImageBundle is a Symfony bundle providing tools to resize local/remote images before uploading them through a classic form.
It uses [Cropper][1] jQuery plugin.

## Installation

### Require the bundle as a Composer dependency

```bash
php composer.phar require presta/image-bundle
```

### Enable the bundles in the kernel

You must add the following bundles into `app/AppKernel.php`:

```php
<?php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = [
        // ...
        new Vich\UploaderBundle\VichUploaderBundle(),
        new Presta\ImageBundle\PrestaImageBundle(),
    ];
}
```

### Configure the bundle

You must use the `image_widget.html.twig` form theme into `app/config.yml`.

```yml
twig:
    form_themes:
        - "PrestaImageBundle:form:image_widget.html.twig"
```

You must include the routing into `app/config/routing.yml`:

```yml
presta_image:
    resource: "@PrestaImageBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
```

See VichUploader [documentation][5] to configure the bundle.

### Install assets

See Cropper [quick start section][2] to install assets.

Note that [jQuery][3] and [Bootstrap][4] are required.

Don't forget to include the following assets in your page:

- `/path/to/cropper/dist/cropper.min.css`
- `/path/to/cropper/dist/cropper.min.js`
- `@PrestaImageBundle/Resources/public/css/cropper.css`
- `@PrestaImageBundle/Resources/public/js/cropper.js`

## Usage

### Initialize cropper

```javascript
(function(w, $) {

    'use strict';

    $(function() {
        $('.cropper').each(function() {
            new Cropper($(this));
        });
    });

})(window, jQuery);
```

### Use the form type

```php
<?php

use Presta\ImageBundle\Form\Type\ImageType;

public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
{
    $builder
        ->add('image', ImageType::class)
    ;
}
```

Available options for the `ImageType`:

- `aspect_ratio` (`array`): a list of aspect ratio to apply when resizing an image
- `cropper_options` (`array`): a list of options supported by cropper (default: `['autoCropArea' => 1]`)
- `max_width` (`int`): the max width of the cropped image send to server (default: `320`)
- `max_height` (`int`): the max height of the cropped image send to server (default: `180`)
- `preview_width` (`int`): the max width to use when displaying the image preview (default: `320`)
- `preview_height` (`int`): the max height to use when displaying the image preview (default: `180`)
- `download_uri` (`string`): the path where the image is located (default: `null`, automatically set)
- `download_link` (`bool`): whether the end user should be able to add a remote image by URL (default: `true`)
- `upload_mimetype` (`string`): format of the image to be uploaded (default: `image/png`)  
  (Note: If choosen mimetype is not supported by browser it will silently fall back to `image/png`)
- `upload_quality` (`float`): quality (0..1) of uploaded image for lossy imageformats (eg. `image/jpeg`) (default: `0.92`)   
#### Notes

You can find Cropper options [here](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper#options).

The `max_width` and `max_height` options are used to define maximum size the cropped uploaded image will be.
Bigger images (after cropping) are scaled down.

**Security Note:** NEVER rely on this size constraints and the format settings as 
they can be easily manipulated client side. ALWAYS validate the image-data, -size, -format 
at server side!
